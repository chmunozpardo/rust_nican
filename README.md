This is a small project to read data from the Front End devices through CAN bus using Rust and the National Instrument CAN drivers.

You need to have at least the NICAN drivers installed and change the directory for the `.lib` file, in my case `C:/Program Files (x86)/National Instruments/NI-CAN/MS Visual C/`, inside the `src/builds.rs` to point your current folder.
